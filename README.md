# TwitterDogsAnalysis

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the 
dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost 
always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." 
WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
Data used in this project was provided by Udacity and as it was a requirement for my data 
analyst nanodegree program. The archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, 
etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. The data was cleaned to 
remove redundant data. However, not all of the desired data is present in Udacity's dataset, so I also use the Twitter API to gather additional data.
